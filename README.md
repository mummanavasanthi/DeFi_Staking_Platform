# 🏗️ Architecture

The platform consists of two major components:

## Smart Contract Layer

### Staking.sol

A Solidity smart contract deployed on SecureChain AI Mainnet responsible for:

* Accepting ETH deposits
* Managing staking balances
* Reward calculation
* Reward claiming
* Processing withdrawals

### Core Functions

#### stake()

Allows users to stake ETH into the protocol.

#### withdraw(uint256 amount)

Allows users to withdraw previously staked ETH.

#### getBalance(address user)

Returns the user's staked balance.

#### calculateReward(address user)

Calculates pending staking rewards.

#### claimReward()

Allows users to claim accumulated rewards.

## Frontend Layer

The frontend is built using React.js, Vite, and Ethers.js and provides:

* Wallet Connectivity
* Staking Dashboard
* Reward Tracking
* Activity Monitoring
* Smart Contract Interaction
